                <p><strong><em>Bharatanatyam</em></strong> is an Indian classical dance form that originated in Tamil
                    Nadu.It is one of
                    eight Indian classical dance forms recognized by the Sangeet Natak Akademi, and expresses South
                    Indian religious themes and spiritual ideas, particularly of Shaivism and in
                    general of Hinduism.
                </p>
                <p> A description of precursors of Bharatanatyam from the 2nd century CE can be found in the ancient
                    Tamil epic Silappatikaram, while temple sculptures of the 6th to 9th century CE suggest dance
                    was a
                    refined performance art by the mid-1st millennium CE. Sadiraattam, which was renamed
                    Bharatanatyam in 1932, is the oldest classical dance tradition in India. Bharatanatyam is the
                    state dance form of Tamil Nadu.
                </p>
                <p> Bharatanatyam contains different types of banis. Bani, or "tradition", is a term used to
                    describe
                    the dance technique and style specific to a guru or school, often named for the village of the
                    guru.
                    Bharatanatyam style is noted for its fixed upper torso, bent legs and knees flexed (Araimandi)
                    combined with footwork, and a vocabulary of sign language based on gestures of hands, eyes, and
                    face
                    muscles. The dance is accompanied by music and a singer, and typically the dancer's guru is
                    present as the nattuvanar or director-conductor of the performance and art. The performance
                    repertoire of Bharatanatyam, like other classical dances, includes nrita (pure dance), nritya
                    (solo
                    expressive dance) and natya (group dramatic dance).
                </p>
                <p> Sadiraattam remained exclusive to Hindu temples through the 19th century. It was banned by the
                    colonial British government in 1910, but the Indian community protested against the ban and
                    expanded its performance outside temples in the 20th century as Bharatanatyam. Modern
                    stage productions of Bharatanatyam have become popular throughout India and include performances
                    that are purely dance-based on non-religious ideas and fusion themes. The Thanjavur Quartet
                    developed the basic structure of modern Bharatanatyam by formalizing it.</p>

                <p> <strong><em>Kuchipudi</em></strong> is one of the eight major Indian classical dances.It originates
                    from a village named
                    Kuchipudi in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. Kuchipudi is a dance-drama performance, with its
                    roots in the ancient Hindu Sanskrit text of Natya Shastra. It developed as a religious art linked to
                    traveling bards, temples and spiritual beliefs, like all major classical dances of India.
                </p>
                <p> Evidence of Kuchipudi's existence in an older version are found in copper inscriptions of the 10th
                    century, and by the 15th century in texts such as the Machupalli Kaifat.Kuchipudi tradition
                    holds that Tirtha Narayana Yati a sanyassin of Advaita Vedanta persuasion, and his disciple,
                    an orphan named Siddhendra Yogi, founded and systematized the modern version of Kuchipudi in the
                    17th century. Kuchipudi largely developed as a Krishna-oriented Vaishnavism
                    tradition, and it is known by the name of Bhagavata Mela in Thanjavur.
                </p>
                <p> The traditional Kuchipudi was performed by all males troupe. A dancer in a male role would be in
                    Agnivastra, also known as Bagalbandi, wear a dhoti (a single pleated piece of cloth hanging down
                    from the waist). A dancer in a female role would wear a Sari with light makeup. The
                    Kuchipudi performance usually begins with an invocation. Then, each costumed actor is introduced,
                    their role stated, and they then perform a short preliminary dance set to music (dharavu). Next, the
                    performance presents pure dance (nritta). This is followed with by the expressive part of the
                    performance (nritya), where rhythmic hand gestures help convey the story. Vocal and
                    instrumental Carnatic music in the Telugu language accompanies the performance. The typical
                    musical instruments in Kuchipudi are mridangam, cymbals, veena, flute and the tambura. The
                    popularity of Kuchipudi has grown within India and it is performed worldwide.

            <div class="content">
                <p> <strong><em>Mohiniyattam</em></strong> is an Indian classical dance form that developed and remained
                    popular in the state of Kerala. Kathakali is another classical dance form of Kerala.
                    Mohiniyattam dance gets its name from the word Mohini a historical enchantress avatar of the Hindu
                    God Vishnu, who helps the good prevail over evil by developing her feminine powers.
                </p>
                <p> Mohiniyattam's roots, like all classical Indian dances, are in the Natya Shastra the ancient Hindu
                    Sanskrit text on performance arts. However, it follows the Lasya style described in Natya
                    Shastra, that is a dance which is delicate, eros-filled and feminine. It is traditionally a
                    solo dance performed by women after extensive training, though nowadays men can also perform the
                    dance. The repertoire of Mohiniyattam includes music in the Carnatic style, singing
                    and acting a play through the dance, where the recitation may be either by a separate vocalist or
                    the dancer themselves. The song is typically in Malayalam-Sanskrit hybrid called Manipravalam.
                </p>
                <p> The earliest mention of the word is found in the 16th-century legal text Vyavaharamala, but the
                    likely roots of the dance are older. The dance was systematized in the 18th century, was
                    ridiculed as a Devadasi prostitution system during the colonial British Raj, banned by a series of
                    laws from 1931 through 1938, a ban that was protested and partially repealed in 1940. The
                    socio-political conflict ultimately led to renewed interest, revival and reconstruction of
                    Mohiniyattam by the people of Kerala, particularly the poet Vallathol Narayana Menon.

            <div class="content">
                <p> <strong><em>Kathakali</em></strong> is a major form of classical Indian dance. It is a "story play"
                    genre of art, but one distinguished by the elaborately colourful make-up and costumes of the traditional male
                    actor-dancers. It is native to the Malayalam-speaking southwestern region of Kerala
                    and is almost entirely practiced and appreciated by Malayali people.
                </p>
                <p> Kathakali's roots are unclear. The fully developed style of Kathakali originated around the 17th
                    century, but its roots are in the temple and folk arts (such as Krishnanattam and religious drama of
                    the kingdom of the Zamorin of Calicut) southwestern Indian peninsula, which are traceable to at
                    least the 1st millennium CE. A Kathakali performance, like all classical dance arts of India,
                    synthesizes music, vocal performers, choreography and hand and facial gestures together to express
                    ideas. However, Kathakali differs in that it also incorporates movements from ancient Indian martial
                    arts and athletic traditions of South India. Kathakali also differs in that the structure
                    and details of its art form developed in the courts and theatres of Hindu principalities, unlike
                    other classical Indian dances which primarily developed in Hindu temples and monastic
                    schools.
                </p>
                <p> The traditional themes of the Kathakali are folk stories, religious legends and spiritual ideas from
                    the Hindu epics and the Puranas. The vocal performance has traditionally been performed in
                    Sanskritised Malayalam. In modern compositions, Indian Kathakali troupes have included women
                    artistes, and adapted Western stories and plays such as those by Shakespeare.
